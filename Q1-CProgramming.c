returns:
1 if the target was found in the list
0, otherwise*/
//Answer:




  
/*(d) [10 Marks] test your function in main by creating a list of 10 nodes and then call the searchList function to search for a certain value, make sure you check 
the correctness of the returned value from the function by comparing it against what you expect. */
